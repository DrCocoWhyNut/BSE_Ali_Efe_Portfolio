# Final Milestone

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my laptop The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Since there was no available monitors, i had to remotely hook my Raspberry Pi to my laptop by altering and adding files to the sd card.
